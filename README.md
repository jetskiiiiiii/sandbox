# PRACTICES
- git practices
1. remote branches will be removed once merged
2. if you are making changes and find that you have been working on wrong branch, google it (different based on commited/uncommitted)
3. before pushing local branch, update local main (and thus the local branch)
4. instead of git pull, use git fetch + git log <local-branch>..<remote-branch> + git merge
5. name branches with "high-level/low-level" syntax

- general practices
1. when authenticating pages, create separate auth component and wrap component in Suspense in page.tsx

2. for now, authenticate using getUser

  - Rio
    - create-post
        - post images
            - add caption to images
        - (DONE) currently public
        - function to save draft
        - post text/video
        - add ui
        - (DONE) redirect to profile homepage after upload
        - constraing status column in supabase to "draft" or "published"

# UI FLOWS 
    - Creations Dashboard
        - has published and drafts in "all" organized by date
            - tabs for published and draft
        - each creation has a unique id
            - if id exists, load draft
            - else, load empty 
        - each creation is a canvas where users can put texts, images, videos anywhere
        - 
    - Post layout
        - idea 1: freeform, put text/images/videos anywhere, floating elements with editors for each specific element type
            - pros: cool web experience, difficult mobile implementation   
        - idea 2: blocked elements in semi-freeform grid placements
            - pinterest-like arrangment with each post as a collection of videos/images/texts

# IDEAS
- video only section to scroll through all videos/images-as-videos(autogenerated) on platform
    - include "Part of [POST NAME] by [USERNAME]"
